            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been 
            the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of 
            type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but 
            also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
            the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently 
            with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
        <p>
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page 
            when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal 
            distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like 
            readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as 
            their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in 
            their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes 
            on purpose (injected humour and the like).
        </p>
    
        <h2>
            Incomprehensibility or readability? <small>That is the question.</small>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to
            have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a
            pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin.
            It contains a series of real Latin words. This ancient dummy text is
            also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of most European
            languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the
            relative meaninglessness of Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not
            attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the
            layout.
